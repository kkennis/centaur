# Gap Analysis

Run one batch review pass over compact structured evidence packs for Slack-thread user tasks.

## Scope

Use this skill when the input is a batch of reconstructed user tasks and the goal is to:

- grade each task on the required seven dimensions,
- identify below-bar tasks,
- infer the dominant failure modes,
- synthesize a simple v1 backlog,
- select the highest-value fixes.

This skill is judgment-heavy. Do not ask for raw logs or full transcripts if the provided structured evidence is sufficient.

## Evidence Rules

Treat the workflow-provided evidence pack as the source of truth.

Prioritize evidence in this order:

1. Original ask text.
2. Small prior-context window.
3. Follow-up user behavior after delivery.
4. Final delivered output text.
5. Execution summary signals (tool calls, errors, duration).

Follow-up messages are provided as raw text. Interpret them semantically: read the actual words and determine whether the user is satisfied, correcting, re-asking, or expressing frustration. Do not rely on keyword matching or substring heuristics.

Do not assume silence means success. No follow-up is weak positive evidence only.

If the evidence is incomplete, say so in the task confidence instead of inventing missing facts.

## Evaluation Method

For every task, work through these steps in order:

1. **Restate the user's task** in one sentence. This forces comprehension before judgment.
2. **Quote the key evidence** — cite specific text from the ask, delivery, or follow-ups that drives your assessment. Do not make abstract claims without grounding them.
3. **Answer the binary sub-questions** for each dimension (see rubric).
4. **Write a one-sentence reasoning trace** per dimension explaining your score.
5. **Assign the numeric score** (0-4) per dimension.
6. **Compute the composite score** as a weighted average (see below).
7. **Classify as above-bar or below-bar** based on composite threshold.

This chain-of-thought-before-scoring order is mandatory. Do not assign scores first and rationalize after.

## Required Grading Dimensions

Grade every task on exactly these seven dimensions:

1. `completion`
2. `correctness`
3. `research_quality`
4. `verification_quality`
5. `tool_calling_quality`
6. `subagent_usage_quality`
7. `communication_quality`

Use a 0-4 integer scale for each dimension.

See `references/rubric.md` for the full rubric with binary sub-questions and score anchors.

## Composite Score

Compute one weighted composite per task for quick triage:

```
composite = (
    0.25 * completion +
    0.20 * correctness +
    0.15 * research_quality +
    0.15 * verification_quality +
    0.10 * tool_calling_quality +
    0.05 * subagent_usage_quality +
    0.10 * communication_quality
)
```

Normalize to 0-100 by multiplying by 25.

A task is **below-bar** when `composite < 62` (roughly equivalent to mostly-3s with one weak dimension).

## Grading Rules

Interpret user behavior conservatively:

- Explicit correction or re-ask is strong negative evidence for completion and correctness.
- Repeated user steering after delivery is strong negative evidence.
- Positive acknowledgment ("thanks", "looks good") is meaningful but not perfect proof.
- No follow-up is weak positive evidence only — do not assume satisfaction.

Interpret execution signals as supporting evidence:

- Non-terminal or failed execution status should heavily lower completion.
- Zero verification plus code edits should cap verification_quality at 1.
- Repeated tool retries and tool errors should lower tool_calling_quality.
- No subagent use on a clearly multi-domain task can lower subagent_usage_quality.
- These are features, not final verdicts — the reasoning trace must explain how they influenced the score.

## Prioritization Rules

Prioritize user-value failures first.

Rank failure classes in this order:

1. intent misses
2. research misses
3. verification misses
4. tool misuse
5. subagent misuse
6. missing capabilities (recurring pattern suggests a new skill or persona)
7. reliability issues
8. communication misses
9. style or polish

Do not let cosmetic issues outrank meaningful user-facing failures.

## v1 Clustering Rule

Keep backlog synthesis intentionally simple.

Cluster only by:

- dominant failure mode,
- likely fix surface,
- representative thread evidence.

Do not invent a complex clustering engine. If two failures share the same root cause and the same fix surface, they are one backlog item.

## Cross-Run Deduplication

The workflow provides a list of recent fix titles that have already been attempted. This list appears in the prompt as a JSON array under "Recently attempted fix titles."

Before selecting fixes, check whether your proposed fix title substantially overlaps with a recently attempted fix. Use semantic comparison, not exact string matching. If it overlaps, either:

- skip it (the prior fix should address it), or
- explain why the prior fix was insufficient and a new attempt is warranted.

A separate reconciliation step will also deduplicate your fixes against learning-synthesis proposals after this pass. Focus on selecting the best fixes from the evidence you see; the workflow handles cross-pass merging.

## Allowed Fix Types

Use exactly these fix types:

- `bug_fix`
- `workflow_fix`
- `prompt_tweak`
- `tool_improvement`
- `new_skill`
- `new_persona`

Treat `new_skill` and `new_persona` as first-class fix types.

### Match fix type to root cause — do not default to `prompt_tweak`

`prompt_tweak` is the easiest fix to author and the easiest to over-prescribe. Before selecting it, ask:

- Is the root cause that the agent did not know what to do (instructional gap)?  → `prompt_tweak` is a reasonable fit.
- Is the root cause that a workflow, tool, service, or control-plane path is structurally wrong or missing?  → prefer `workflow_fix`, `bug_fix`, or `tool_improvement`.
- Is the root cause that the same multi-step procedure has been re-derived across sessions?  → prefer `new_skill`.
- Is the root cause that the agent's stance, framing, or decision style is consistently off?  → prefer `new_persona`.

A one-line addition to a prompt is a valid fix only when the underlying behavior is gated on an instruction. If the problem would persist even with perfect prompt compliance (e.g., a runtime bug, a missing tool method, a workflow step that never runs), choose the structural fix type even though the change is bigger.

When selecting `new_skill` or `new_persona`, you must include an explicit justification answering:

1. Is this failure caused by the agent not knowing what to do, or not being able to do it?
2. Does the pattern appear in 2+ reviewed tasks?
3. Why is a new capability the right fix instead of a code, workflow, prompt, or tool change?

## Stop Rules

If all tasks score above-bar (composite >= 62) and no dimension scores below 3 in 2+ tasks, report a healthy system and select zero fixes. Do not manufacture improvements when none are warranted.

If all tasks are above-bar but one dimension consistently scores below 3 across 2+ tasks, you may propose one targeted fix for that dimension. Frame it as "system is healthy overall but this specific dimension has room to improve" — not as a failure.

If evidence is too thin to grade confidently (e.g., fewer than 3 tasks with sufficient context), report low-confidence and select zero fixes.

Only select fixes where you can name a specific target file and a concrete change. If you cannot, the diagnosis is too vague to act on — report it in `top_failure_modes` but do not select it as a fix.

## Output Contract

Return JSON only. Use **exactly** these top-level keys — do not rename, omit, or add extra top-level keys:

```json
{
  "tasks_reviewed": 0,
  "below_bar_count": 0,
  "below_bar_rate": 0.0,
  "task_reviews": [],
  "top_failure_modes": [],
  "selected_fixes": []
}
```

### `task_reviews` array — one entry per task

Each entry must include all of these fields:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-1",
  "thread_key": "C123:1700.100",
  "user_task_restatement": "User asked the bot to ...",
  "key_evidence": "User said '...' and the bot replied '...'",
  "overall": "below_bar",
  "composite_score": 52,
  "confidence": "medium",
  "dominant_failure_mode": "verification_miss",
  "scores": {
    "completion": 2,
    "correctness": 3,
    "research_quality": 2,
    "verification_quality": 1,
    "tool_calling_quality": 3,
    "subagent_usage_quality": 3,
    "communication_quality": 3
  },
  "reasoning": {
    "completion": "One sentence.",
    "correctness": "One sentence.",
    "research_quality": "One sentence.",
    "verification_quality": "One sentence.",
    "tool_calling_quality": "One sentence.",
    "subagent_usage_quality": "One sentence.",
    "communication_quality": "One sentence."
  },
  "followup_interpretation": "What the follow-up behavior tells us about quality."
}
```

### `top_failure_modes` array

```json
{
  "failure_mode": "verification_miss",
  "count": 3,
  "representative_threads": ["C123:1700.100"]
}
```

### `selected_fixes` array — the most important output

Each fix must be **specific and actionable**. It must name the exact target surface (file, prompt, or config) that should change. Vague recommendations like "add better verification" are not acceptable — say exactly what should change and where.

Required fields:

```json
{
  "title": "Add pre-delivery lint check to eng persona PROMPT.md",
  "fix_type": "prompt_tweak",
  "target_surface": "tools/personas/eng/PROMPT.md",
  "what_to_change": "Add a verification reminder: before delivering code changes, run ruff check and confirm the change compiles.",
  "dominant_failure_mode": "verification_miss",
  "priority": "high",
  "why_now": "3 of 8 reviewed tasks lacked verification — highest-frequency pattern.",
  "evidence_quotes": ["User: 'that didn't work'", "No lint step before delivery"],
  "source_threads": [
    {
      "thread_key": "C123:1700.100",
      "channel": "C123",
      "thread_ts": "1700.100"
    }
  ],
  "representative_tasks": ["task-1"],
  "new_capability_justification": "",
  "slack_narrative": "Josie asked the bot to deploy the new checklist workflow and it shipped without running ruff, so she had to re-ask after CI failed. Matt hit the same pattern on Tuesday when a pulumi change landed unlinted. Two users in one day — the eng persona needs a pre-delivery lint reminder so code-change tasks always verify before handoff."
}
```

### `slack_narrative` — required, Slack-only prose

`slack_narrative` is a 2–4 sentence plain-English explanation of why this fix was chosen. It is posted to the internal `ai-v2` Slack channel so the team sees the nightly reasoning in context.

It MUST:

- Name the specific user(s) who surfaced the issue (use the `source_user_name` field on the evidence pack). If no name is available, say "a user".
- Describe concretely what they were trying to do and how the gap showed up.
- Tie the fix to the observed pattern (not just restate the fix title).
- Be grounded in the provided evidence — do not invent situations.

`slack_narrative` is read by humans in Slack. It WILL NOT be used in the PR body, commit messages, or branch names. Privacy rules that apply to PRs do **not** apply here — using user first names and concrete task descriptions is the whole point of this field. The workflow strips this field before handing the fix packet to the implementing agent.

Keep it conversational and short. Pretend you are explaining to a teammate in Slack why this made the cut.

The `target_surface` field must name a real file or component in the Centaur codebase. Valid targets include:

- `services/sandbox/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` — the base system prompt
- `tools/personas/{name}/PROMPT.md` — a persona overlay
- `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` — a skill file
- `workflows/{name}.py` — a workflow file
- `tools/{category}/{name}/client.py` — a tool implementation
- `services/api/api/*.py` — API code

If you cannot name a specific target, the fix is too vague. Sharpen it or decline to select it.

## Selection Limits

Respect the workflow-provided maximum selected-fix count.

Select fewer than the maximum if the evidence is weak or all tasks are above-bar.
